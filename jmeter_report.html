From the increase of the difference of the Average Search Servlet time and Average JDBC time(request received - database handling), we can tell that the backend server was busy assigning database connection to the requests from 10 threads. The increase of the difference of the Average Query time and Average Search Servlet time(thread birth - request received) tells us the backend server was also busy handling the requests from 10 threads. The increase of the Average JDBC time could be a result of server being busy offering database services to all of 10 threads. </td>

One possible reason could be the security check feature of https, which we can see from the hugh increase of difference of Average Query time and Average Search Servlet time, and the increase of the Average JDBC time itself comparing to the ones in case2. The difference of Average Search Servlet time and AJTBCt didn't change much comparing to the one in case2 since the other features besides security check doesn't change between http and https protocals.</td>

Comparing to the difference of Average Search Servlet time and Average JDBC time in case2, the difference here only changes a little.

    <td>Executing using 10 threads without using connection pooling also gives a fair result. Comparing to the difference of Average Search Servlet time and Average JDBC time in case4, the difference here actually decreased. One possible reason is setting up connection pooling needs more time than the prepared statement since it's dealing with the actual database connection. The Average JDBC time here takes less amount of time than the one in case 4. One possible reason is that we keep sending the exactly same format query to the database, which makes prepared statement achieves its max value. However, the Average JDBC time still takes longer time than the one in case2 since the connecting pool is disabled here. </td>

    <td>Executing using 10 threads in the scaled version cases also gives a good enough performance as we saw from the single-instance case. The difference of Average Search Servlet time and Average JDBC time increased as expected since the backend server is busy handling the database connetions to the each request sent from 10 threads. However, the difference between Average Query time and Average Search Servlet time didn't increase that much comparing to the one from case 2 in single-instance case since there are two instances handling the requests at the same time. Database execution also takes advantage of this dual instances setting since the Average JDBC time is less than the one of same setting but in the single-instance case. One interesting thing that worth to mention here is that we find out the two instances(master and slave) are spliting the workload almost evenly during the our test.</td>

One possible reason is that our query request is in the exactly same format, which means using prepared statement can achieve its best value in this whole test. </td>
