Author: Zhou, Peng  pzhou2@uci.edu

## Version 2.0
### Easy install
1. Change every <your_path> in LoadNewDataCmd.sql to your absolute path of your downloaded NewData directory.
2. Log into mysql using "mysql -u mytestuser -p" command.
3. Enter command "source /<your_path>/LoadNewDataCmd". 
4. If the command above returns error "The used command is not allowed with this MySQL version", logout, and login to mysql again with command "mysql --local-infile=1 -u mytestuser -p", then execute step 3 again.

### Generating csv files
1. Import XML_handler into your IDE.
2. Replace all file paths (.xml input file and .csv output file) to your desired file paths.
3. Run "Main.java".
4. Load "NewStarInMovies.csv" into moviedb.

## Version 1.0 (Deprecated)
### Easy install
1. Change every <your_path> in LoadNewDataCmd.sql to your absolute path of your downloaded NewData directory.
2. Log into mysql using "mysql -u mytestuser -p" command.
3. Enter command "source /<your_path>/LoadNewDataCmd". 
4. If the command above returns error "The used command is not allowed with this MySQL version", logout, and login to mysql again with command "mysql --local-infile=1 -u mytestuser -p", then execute step 3 again.

### Generating csv files
1. Import XML_handler into your IDE.
2. Replace all file paths (.xml input file and .csv output file) to your desired file paths.
3. Run "StarsParser.java" and "MainParser.java".
    NOTE: Running "StarsParser.java" is slow, because the program has to check whether each of the stars in input file is already in moviedb.
4. Load all .csv files generated by above programs into moviedb, using the commands and mysql login method mentioned in "Easy install" section.
5. Run "CastParser.java".
    NOTE: Running this step is extremely slow, and it must be run after finishing all steps above, because it must check all new data loaded into moviedb to match each star in movie with its id in moviedb.
6. Load "NewStarInMovies.csv" into moviedb.
